# Gridfinity Tile Generator (Blender Addon)
[![Blender 4.3+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-4.3%2B-orange)](https://www.blender.org/)

This is my **first Blender add-on project** — a tool that generates Gridfinity-compatible base tiles inside Blender with adjustable rows, columns, and optional magnet holes.

This Blender addon allows you to quickly generate customizable Gridfinity base tiles with optional magnet holes, directly inside the 3D Viewport. Perfect for makers, 3D printing enthusiasts, and anyone building modular Gridfinity-style organization systems.
