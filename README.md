# Gridfinity Tile Generator (Blender Addon)
[![Blender 4.3+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-4.3%2B-orange)](https://www.blender.org/)

This is my **first Blender add-on project** — a tool that generates Gridfinity-compatible base tiles inside Blender with adjustable rows, columns, and optional magnet holes. More to come but, I figured I would put the bones out there and see if anyone wanted to make some improvments.
